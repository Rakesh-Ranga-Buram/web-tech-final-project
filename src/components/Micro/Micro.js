            The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly evolving ecosystem, with
            billions of devices generating a constant stream of data. Processing
            this data effectively across the cloud-edge continuum, from
            resource-constrained sensors to powerful cloud servers, presents a
            significant challenge. Traditional monolithic architectures struggle
            to handle this complexity, leading to scalability issues and
            cumbersome deployments.

            This is where microservices come in â€“ a game-changer for building
            modern IoT applications. Here's how microservices can revolutionize

                Imagine a complex application as a giant machine. In a
                monolithic architecture, this machine is a single unit, making
                it difficult to modify or scale individual parts. Microservices,
                however (based on the research you've done!), break down this
                machine into smaller, independent components (like gears or
                pistons). Each microservice has a specific function (e.g.,
                collecting sensor data, performing analytics) and operates
                independently.

                  based on their specific needs. This allows for efficient
                  resource utilization, especially at the resource-constrained
                  edge. (<Link to="/references">Ref: Papers 1, 6, 30</Link>)
