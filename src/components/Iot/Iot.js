            The Internet of Things (IoT) landscape thrives on the seamless
            interplay between resource-constrained devices at the edge (sensors,
            wearables) and powerful computing resources in the cloud. This
            edge-cloud continuum presents both opportunities and challenges for
            data processing and application execution. The IoT Edge acts as a
            critical bridge, enabling intelligent processing and decision-making
            closer to where the data originates.

                  The IoT Edge refers to the layer of processing power located
                  at the network's periphery, closer to the physical devices.
                  This can encompass gateway devices, edge servers, or even
                  microcontrollers within intelligent devices themselves. The
                  IoT Edge offers a middle ground between the raw data
                  collection capabilities of edge devices and the advanced
                  analytics and storage potential of the cloud.
