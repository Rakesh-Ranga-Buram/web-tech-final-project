            The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly evolving, with billions of
            devices generating a constant stream of data. Microservices and
            nanoservices have emerged as powerful architectural paradigms to
            address the challenges of processing this data effectively across
            the resource-constrained edge and the powerful cloud.

              This survey has explored the potential of microservices and
              nanoservices to build robust, scalable, and flexible IoT
              applications. We delved into the key benefits these architectures
              offer, including:
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              <b>Scalability:</b> Microservices and nanoservices enable
              independent scaling based on specific needs, optimizing resource
              utilization across the edge-cloud continuum.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              <b>Flexibility:</b> New features can be introduced or existing
              ones modified by deploying new services without affecting the
              entire application, fostering faster development cycles.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              <b>Faster Development and Deployment:</b> Smaller, independent
              services enable faster development and easier deployments at the
              edge or in the cloud.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              <b>Improved Fault Tolerance:</b> Issues in one service are
              isolated, minimizing impact on the overall application's
              functionality.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              <b>Technology Agnosticism:</b> Different services can be developed
              using various programming languages and technologies, allowing for
              flexibility in choosing the best tool for the job.
            </div>

          <div>
            We also explored the challenges associated with these approaches,
            such as increased complexity and distributed system management.
            However, the potential benefits far outweigh these considerations,
            especially as the technology matures and best practices are
            established.
